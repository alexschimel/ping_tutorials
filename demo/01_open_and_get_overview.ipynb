    "\n",
    "- pings.sort_by_time() will sort the pings by time\n",
    "- pings.break_at_time(t) will split the PingContainer into PingContainers when the time difference between two pings is larger than t\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this tutorial. Here is what you have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open files using the em3000.FileEM3000_mapped function, remember that this class takes a list of many files at once\n",
    "- em3000.FileEM3000_mapped indexes the provided files, this process can be speed up by using an previously created index file\n",
    "- Ping revolves around pings and the main function to access them is fm.pings()\n",
    "- These pings can be sorted into new list and copied as much as you like. This allows for sorting and selecting pings before doing expensive data processing\n",
    "- Pings are the basic unit of data in themachinethatgoesping. They contain cached data and provide access to the raw datagrams that belong to them.\n",
    "- Datagrams are only read completely if the datagram is loaded into memory, or if a function is called that requires the datagram data.\n",
    "- Pings provide high level functions to the user. E.g. get_geolocation which provides the interpolated and transformed geolocation of the pings transducer at ping time. To speed these functions up, some data is internally cached in the ping object.\n",
    "- Additionally, we showed you how sorting and selecting pings can be used to create a overview of the data by plotting the navigation data onto an interactive map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to play around. Stay tuned for the next tutorial where we will actually access data and do something with that"
